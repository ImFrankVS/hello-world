# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub :D

## This is the second-main
In this section I may save the most important changes from the code.

### What else??
For example I can save some important info to have in mind, but i'm not sure

    Something like this:

    ```
      {
        "firstName": "Francisco",
        "lastName": "Victorio",
        "age": 22
      }
    ```


Or better than just info I might put some code for a challenge:

    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
    The sum of these multiples is 23.
    
    Find the sum of all the multiples of or below 1000.
    
## Answer for Python
    ```
    limupper = 1000
    total_sum = 0
    
    for list_of_numbers in range(1, limupper):
        if list_of_numbers % 3 == 0 or list_of_numbers % 5 == 0:
            total_sum += list_of_numbers
    
    print(total_sum)
    
    ```
